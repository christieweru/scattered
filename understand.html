        <h3 class="u-h3">Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
          Many existing platforms offer strong core community features such as posting, discussion, and moderation.
          Some excel in specific areas: Citizen and Neighbors by Ring focus on real-time, map-based alerts; Reddit and
          NextDoor enable ongoing conversation and search; and Change.org and Turn Up Activism support cause-driven
          mobilization. Together, these tools show that awareness and discussion are well-established components of
          digital community spaces.
        </p>
        <p>
          While these platforms are useful, the ecosystem is fragmented. This fragmentation forces users to rely on
          multiple platforms to stay informed, which can hinder participation in their community. There is no single platform that seamlessly connects awareness, verification, communication, and meaningful action. Users often need to switch
          between tools, and most platforms stop at informing or discussing issues rather than guiding next steps. Young
          adults, in particular, are underserved, as existing solutions skew toward older audiences or isolated forms of
          engagement. This presents a clear opportunity to create a centralized, youth-centered platform that bridges
          discovery, connection, and coordinated action, turning concern into tangible community impact.

        <h3 class="u-h3">Method</h3>
        <p>
          To better understand our target audience, each team member conducted one 30-minute semi-structured interview
          with a college student recruited through our extended networks. No identifying information was collected to
          ensure participant privacy.
        </p>
        <p>
          We used a prepared question guide with open-ended prompts such as, “How do you stay updated on community
          events?” and “Do you find it easy or difficult to get involved in causes you care about?” This format allowed
          for consistency across interviews while giving participants space to share their motivations, frustrations,
          and experiences. We took detailed notes and captured key quotes to identify patterns in how young adults
          discover issues, navigate opportunities, and encounter barriers to action. A qualitative approach was selected
          to better understand the behaviors and perceptions that surveys alone may not reveal.
