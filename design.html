        To accurately determine the overall design of our application, we decided to create two key storyboards that
        would highlight our core features and a typical user’s interactions with them.

              The storyboard highlights the actions and thoughts of a typical user. The user opens our application to
              identify potential ongoing issues in their community. From there the user sees an issue important to them
              and shares it with their friends. This generates community engagement and gives more attention to the
              issue so that it can be reported and solved.

        <h2 class="h2 tight">How Research Informed Our Design</h2>
        <p class="muted">
          Our prototype is grounded in key insights gathered from user research, which highlighted several core needs:
          timely access to important issues, a centralized way to take immediate action, and meaningful connection with
          like-minded peers. These insights directly shaped our design decisions throughout the storyboarding, task flow,
          and user flow development process. To address the need for timely awareness, we designed a real-time
          notifications feature that keeps users informed about relevant events and opportunities as they arise. To
          reduce friction between awareness and action, we created a centralized hub within Groups where users can
          access resources and take next steps through clearly defined action buttons. Finally, to support users’ desire
          for community and sustained engagement, we incorporated a messaging system that enables users to connect and
          collaborate with others who share similar interests. By intentionally aligning each feature with validated user
          needs, our design aims to reduce barriers to participation and create a more seamless path from awareness to
          action.
